            <h1>"Multi-Identity" Character Model: Design Project (2024)</h1>
            <p>
                I had worked on the concept of a "multi-identity" character model through a class, and the
                idea/design of this work was to potentially create a character model that can accommodate for different
                identities. My interest as why I started working on this was that I wanted to make a work that will link
                to a game that I will continue work on, but mainly as an opportunity for myself to bond more with
                friends that I have an identity they go by, and through this work I believe that I will be more
                knowledgeable in a way, be more understanding, and getting closer to them. Around the time of April 10,
                2024, I was able to run down different variations of identities and get chunks of people into interview
                and Google Forms. This design project could later be redone and implemented into a game I'll work on, or
                trying out at
                making a possible plug-in.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project was completed, this project was capable of healthy discourse and informative sessions, and
                has yielded positive results in its reception. This success will be reiterated at a future time.

            <p>
                This short and quickly made render/animation was made part of an assignment under a uses of "keywords" I
                had chosen, which were "Working Failure". While incompleteness could be seen in its lack of refinement,
                and other objects outside the camera view. I felt like facing the "failure", or incompleteness, as in
                the way I perceive myself as one as results of insecurities and disabilities, and how through those
                fallacies I believe that I am not fit for greatness or admiration. And recently, I've been feeling a bit
                better through sharing ideas and meetings with a therapist, although with stress at the time of writing
                this, I just have to acknowledge myself as someone who actually is competent, just afraid of everything,
                practice myself and self-care, I just need to take some time for my actual self instead of my ludic
                self. Self negligence could be seen a seething and irritating red while self care and calmness could
                seen as soothing dim light and caress of bedsheets.

            <h1>"Daemmy" Character Model (2022)</h1>
            <p>
                This project helped me carry out thinking about “how” I should create a character model through the
                blocking out of a drawn design, “what” would be complementary to a character design through the process
                of sculpting, texturing, and animations, lastly “why” it reflects outward. While it was the start of my
                3D modelling, it is significant to me that drawing is a powerful fundamental skill to have as one will
                be able to express through shapes and signs. While the retopology was done automatically for this work,
                it was an exercise with coming up with a character idea and working through it. It was also an
                introduction to animation for me through the creation of a walkcycle, and trying the model out into a
                game engine.

            <p>
                This project has taught me the invaluable skill of topology, not only would this be a start of me not
                taking pictures of myself more often, but also beginning to just take pictures of the world around me.
                An example of my new haphazard habit of pulling out my phone and snap an image of the view or object of
                interest, as for what I've been specific, it would be buildings from certain views, my perspective
                during harsh weathers, toy guns, etc.

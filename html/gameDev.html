        <h1>Game Development: Project “Homunculus” (In Progress)</h1>
        <p>
            Realizing the concept of Project “Homunculus” was a turning point for me in terms of expanding my curiosity
            for a plethora of new interests. The main theme, or the research question I wondered was “how do we find
            purpose in a sublimating world by AI?”. This question was conceived as a result of the ever-accelerating
            growth of AI and concerns to most of us, a prominent one being pessimistic as different actors which to push
            it forward over human workers. While making it within a class too ambitious for its time frame, I had gotten
            really promising propositions and questions from some peers and the instructors on “how to try to convince
            people of the idea”, which is an idea I've been taking to heart recently.

        <p>
            While it is an “in-progress” thing, I found the conception of this work to be a motivating force for me to
            discover new ways of thought, an opportunity to really get into new tools to tinker with. As a thing I'm
            searching for is to embody the inhabitants of this game's world in different ideologies, so far I've been
            thinking of factions based on intellectualism, hedonism, and nihilism.

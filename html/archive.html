                These here are old works of mine, while not front page, they were fruitful to my growth as an artist and
                to my being.

            <h1>"Urban Crab" (2023)</h1>
            <p>
                A fluffy horseshoe crab imitating other animals through idling and touch. This was a collaborative
                experience with my mother alongside starting an small interest in fabric, but mostly about how different
                “materials” lead to different interactions. This taught me an introduction to electronics and working
                with an Arduino, while learning the importance of "materials" and "interactions".

            <h1>"Surpasseth" (2019)</h1>
            <p>
                My first introduction to game development with a project in Unreal Engine 4, started my passion for game
                development. It is simply a third-person shooter with platforming elements and a few levels. This early
                game was received pretty decently in class at the time. Taught me a few things from knowing how to lead
                people through levels and to set up some documentations for when doing work on games.

            <h1>"Iterative P1" (2022)</h1>
            <p>
                Introduction to prototyping with game development, this project was one of many small prototypes in the
                class in which I did this in. My encouragement to choose this “P1” in particular was because of a peer's
                enjoyment of one segment of the game. That peer mentioned that she really liked a segment where
                visibility was toned down and justoverall dark. Probably helped with thinking more about atmosphere of
                an area.

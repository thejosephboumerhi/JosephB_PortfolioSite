            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p> Hello I am Joseph Boumerhi, I am an artist who is interested in the idea of multiplicity and
                interconnections of objects, as such my favorite subject is game development, and 3D modelling being a
                close second. Besides my main interest, I have dabbled with electronics, audio, and various topics that
                pique my interest. Usually if something might be my interest, I'll either begin looking up documents or
                content creators online and make an effort to digest them progressively, or I could have an obssesive
                drive towards it.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am very enthusiastic about creating artifacts, making game(s) with themes derived from what have been
                piquing my interests and having things in tandem reflect this, so knowledge made manifest in an object.
                Recent interests would include my newfound interest in the “flesh”, how we yearn and wish to intersect
                in an endearing or malicious sense, how one's body, in its obsession or imperfections in the form of
                disabilities can form an opportunity for exploration. I've also been obsessed on the idea of
                multiplicity on how it's resplendent as it is repulsive. I've found gaming, in play and in their
                development, to be an opportunity to explore human desires and processes, and to perhaps divulge
                messages onto a participant. They can be just pure fun if one pleased, they don't need to preach or
                inform.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thinking about games has felt reminiscent to doodling from when I was a kid, the work just comes out,
                rather than meeting a form of resistance when feeling with doing it. For inspirations, I'd honestly just
                say that I'll consume it if it interests me, and in that consumption triggers something I perceived or
                learned from the consumption, I'll draw from it.
            </p>
            <p>
                While my skills are growing further and wider, such as development for games and the web, music, design,
                drawing, 3D modelling, I still have rudimentary knowledge about them. Although my works aren't the most
                refined, I've been deeply heartfelt for them as they were needed for my
                own growth. I've found Concordia, as a place of growth and an institution, led me into becoming more
                insightful and paying attention to nuances and what those nuances represent when observing the world or
                myself.
            </p>
